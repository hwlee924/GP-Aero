## ASPIRE - Airfoil Surface Pressure Information Repository of Experiments 
ASPIRE is an open-source database accessible to the wider aerospace community utilizing the vast, nearly century-old historical repository of experimental airfoil data 

The database was established through an extensive data mining operation for \emph{strictly experimental} pressure distributions for a variety of airfoils. Each entry of ASPIRE consist of experimental $C_p$ measurements for various airfoil geometries, angles of attack ($\alpha$), chord-based Reynolds numbers ($Re$), and Mach numbers ($M$).
