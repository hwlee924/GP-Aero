## ASPIRE - Airfoil Surface Pressure Information Repository of Experiments 
ASPIRE is an open-source database accessible to the wider aerospace community utilizing the vast, nearly century-old historical repository of experimental airfoil data 

The database was established through an extensive data mining operation for \emph{strictly experimental} pressure distributions for a variety of airfoils. Each entry of ASPIRE consist of experimental $C_p$ measurements for various airfoil geometries, angles of attack ($\alpha$), chord-based Reynolds numbers ($Re$), and Mach numbers ($M$).

## Available Data
ASPIRE consists of 2141 unique pressure distributions from 61 airfoils from various airfoil families and applications. All profiles of the airfoils included in the database, compared against the commonly studied NACA 0012, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:all_af}. Airfoil profiles thicker than a NACA 0012 at the given chordwise location are colored in varying shades of red. Profiles thinner than the NACA 0012 are colored in shades of blue.

The available data ranges from $-30^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}$ in angles of attack ($\alpha$). The Mach number ($M$) of the data spans $0.0$ to $1.0$, from the incompressible regime to transonic and sonic regimes. The number of available pressure data in terms of unique airfoils at a given $M$ and $\alpha$ is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:avail_data}. The color and the number in the center plot denotes the number of unique airfoils available for a given $M$-$\alpha$ combination. Marginal histograms are plotted to provide a clear visualization of the available data at specific $\alpha$ or $M$. These are split in terms of airfoil families, design usage, and supercriticality.
