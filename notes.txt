- changed implementation of the MLP using purely numpyro 
- implemented CST fit using Bernstein polynomial on airfoil profile
- added XFOIL validation data for other types of airfoils: Onera D and Clark Y
- added smooth penalty and weight penalty fx - not used as of now

To do: 
- need to figure out how to parametrize Cp distribution curve for flexibility
- determining Gaussianity of the prediction
- need to make the prediction smooth with an appropriate covariance matrix using multivariate sampling of the final result instead of 1D normal dist
- find and digitize more exp data
- with improved BNN, apply it to the new Shreyas data 

- clean up and organize other codes to git repo
- determine lift distribution (vs. span) conditioning
